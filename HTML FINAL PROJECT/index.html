  <p>Hello! My name is Jessee Torres and I am super big nerd who loves to learn new things, design websites/graphics, tinker in my garage, antique shop and hang out with my St. Bernard named Beethoven. I am a diverse person who loves to try weird food and travel. </p>
  <p>I am happy to be back in college working towards my goal of transferring to University of California Riverside to attain my Bachelors in Computer Science and one day my PhD! I have many goals in my life and hope to be a successful entrepreneur who gets to make a difference, travel the world with my family, and be creative everyday! </p>
  <p>I hope you enjoy my website!</p>
  <p>Best Wishes and Cheers to a life of respect, happiness, and health!</p>
